For every pull request that is opened and labelled for testing, a bot creates a job which creates a vm in google cloud engine, which is then used to run a series of unit and end-to-end tests against the patch being proposed, merged against a copy of the codebase. While this, on average ensures that every patch being merged through a pull request causes no regressions or introduces new bugs, these tests sometimes tend to fail for reasons completely unrelated to the changes being introduced through the patch. These erroneous failures are known as ""test flakes"" and causes of them sometimes involve race-conditions in the tests, infrastructure failure, connectivity issues, etc.

Although these test flakes do not happen often, they sometimes tend to drag out the merge process for a pull request. They also end up consuming more of the developer's time, as test logs have to be examined to conclude that a test failure did not come from the patch itself, test jobs have to be restarted, etc.","The ability for it to recognize test flakes by analyzing common failures ocurring often across multiple pull requests over time, and to restart test jobs automatically when this happens"
